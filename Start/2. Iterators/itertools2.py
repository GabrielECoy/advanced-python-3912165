# Itertools: chain, chain.from_iterable, batched

import itertools


# chain() creates a single iterable from multiple


# make a prepend function


# chain.from_iterable is an alternate usage of chain
s1 = "ABCDEFG"
s2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
s3 = ['$','%','@','&']


# batched() takes an iterable and breaks it into chunks
vals = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'


# batched can be used to reshape iterables
original = [(0,1), (2,3), (4,5), (6,7)]
